# ma321_github_practice
This repository contains the RStudio files associated with Dr. Mehrkam's research project on dog-owner behavior during the 
Spring Semester of 2020.

## MehrkamMasterfilw
This file is the master file containing all the necessary analysis and codes ran for the project. 
It contains desprivtive statistics on all three datasets: SD, EO, and Reinforcer. Here are the master files of the three datasets that were
made to make the data code-friendly in R. In addition, it has the analysis tests run such as Mann-Whitney U Test, Friedman test,
and corresponding post-hoc analyses. The kruskall-wallis test at the end was added in case Dr. Mehrkam wanted to run analysis of the data
as if it was a one-way ANOVA. 

### MehrkamSP20
This file is the "scratch" file that consists of all other statistics that were ran, however, not used in the final master document. It has descriptive
statistics on all the raw data before master files of the datasets were made. It was used essentially to try out different codes and test
before copying to final master file.
